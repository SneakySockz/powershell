This PowerShell script connects to Microsoft Graph API to retrieve Azure AD sign-in logs from the past 7 days. It filters the logs to include only successful sign-ins, excludes entries from Ireland (IE), and optionally omits specific users. The filtered data is then processed and exported as a CSV report to the user's Documents folder.

üîÅ Automating with Power Automate
You can fully automate this reporting process using Power Automate (formerly Microsoft Flow) by following these steps:

‚úÖ 1. Schedule the Script Execution
Use the "Recurrence" trigger in Power Automate to run the flow on a schedule (e.g., daily or weekly).
Add a "Run a PowerShell script" action using:
Azure Automation Runbook (recommended for secure and scalable execution), or
On-premises data gateway if the script runs on a local server.
‚úÖ 2. Store or Share the Output
After the script runs, use Power Automate to:
Upload the CSV to SharePoint, OneDrive, or Azure Blob Storage.
Send the report via email to stakeholders.
Trigger alerts or dashboards in Power BI or Teams.
‚úÖ 3. Monitor and Log
Add logging or notification steps in Power Automate to track:
Script success/failure
Number of records exported
Any anomalies (e.g., no sign-ins found)
